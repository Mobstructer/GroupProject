# GroupProject
COSC 431 Group Project
Our project takes information from the U.S. Census Database about Maryland municipalities and average income to place into a user-friendly application. The goal of our project is to inform our audience of politicians, government agencies, businesses, and people looking to move into the state. Since finding this information is normally difficult or varying in information, we made it easier to access for these people.
