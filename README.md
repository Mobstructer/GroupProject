# GroupProject
COSC 431 Group Project
Our project takes information from the U.S. Census Database about Maryland municipalities and average income to place into a user-friendly application. The goal of our project is to inform our audience of politicians, government agencies, businesses, and people looking to move into the state. Information like this can be difficult to track and often times has discrepancies depending on source material. Our site is sourcing information straight from the US Census Bureau.
